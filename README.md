# LLM-20-Questions

#### Is it a person, place or thing? Is it smaller than a bread box? Is it smaller than a 70B parameter model?

#### 20 Questions is an age-old deduction game where you try to guess a secret word in twenty questions or fewer, using only yes-or-no questions. Players try to deduce the word by narrowing their questions from general to specific, in hopes of guessing the word in the fewest number of questions.

#### Each team will consist of one guesser LLM, responsible for asking questions and making guesses, and one answerer LLM, responsible for responding with "yes" or "no" answers. Through strategic questioning and answering, the goal is for the guesser to correctly identify the secret word in as few rounds as possible.
